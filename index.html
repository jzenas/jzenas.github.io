            <h2>My mission</h2>
            <p>Beyond my technical experience, I am a very inquisitive and growth focused individual. Particularly,
                I believe that it is important to learn about fields outside of computer science in order
                to make a widespread impact. During my times as a waitress at Texas Roadhouse and a sales associate at
                Lands' End,
                I clearly saw how technological innovations could be used to improve the lives of workers, yet there has
                been
                hardly any changes in the
                technologies that restaurants and stores use in decades. I have seen first had how eye-opening it can be
                to look into
                different industries and see the untapped potential of technology. As a result, I want to be a changing
                force in the field
                of computer
                science and bring improvements to aspects of our daily lives that are typically overlooked by technical
                professionals.
                I aspire to think outside of the box, and create positive changes where others fail to look.

            <h2>My Coursework</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Introduction to Operating Systems:</b> A course that taught me about concurrency,
                    synchronization,
                    distributed systems, scheduling, mutexes, memory management, file systems, inter-process
                    communication, and resource management.</li>
                <li><b>Web Systems:</b> A course that taught me about client/server protocols (TCP, UDP), information
                    storage and retrieval, search engines, fault tolerance, and other concepts surrounding web
                    systems.</li>
                <li><b>Software Engineering:</b> A course that taught various software development methodologies and
                    practices that have improved my ability to develop and maintain large scale software systems in
                    a real world environment.</li>
                <li><b>Human-Centered Software Design:</b> A capstone course that allowed me to apply my knowledge in a
                    large, semester long group project. My team and I created a life management app for senior
                    citizens. I am now an Instructional Aide for this class.</li>
                <li><b>Database Management Systems:</b> I am currently taking this class. It will teach me how to
                    design,
                    create, query, and manage large enterprise databases. I will learn about normalization, access
                    methods, query optimization, concurrency control, and more in the context of databases.</li>

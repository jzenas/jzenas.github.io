            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <h2>My mission</h2>
            <p>Beyond my technical experience, I am a very inquisitive and growth focused individual. Particularly,
                I believe that it is important to learn about fields outside of computer science in order
                to make a widespread impact. During my times as a waitress at Texas Roadhouse and a sales associate at
                Lands' End,
                I clearly saw how technological innovations could be used to improve the lives of workers, yet there has
                been
                hardly any changes in the
                technologies that restaurants and stores use in decades. I have seen first had how eye-opening it can be
                to look into
                different industries and see the lost potential. As a result, I want to be a changing force in the field
                of computer
                science and bring improvements to aspects of our daily lives that are typically overlooked by technical
                professionals.
                I aspire to think outside of the box, and create positive changes where others fail to look.
